# Ridged_Regression
Goal of this project is to implement Ridged Regression without using Machine Learning Libraries

In this project, I implemented ridge regression on Sinusoid dataset.
I estimated the training and test RMSE using ten-fold cross validation for the following settings:

1. Add four new feature to the dataset consisting of higher powers of x^p , p ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 5}. 
I used 51 values of λ in [0, 10], so that λ ∈ {0, 0.2, 0.4, . . . , 10} 
2. Add nine new feature to the dataset consisting of higher powers of x^p , p ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 9}. 
I used 51 values of λ in [0, 10], so that λ ∈ {0, 0.2, 0.4, . . . , 10}.
